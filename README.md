# easy-basic-auth-proxy

## Introduction

**easy-basic-auth-proxy** is a web authentication frontend proxy
that bridges Azure Easy Auth and Basic Auth.
Users can use the Basic Auth protocol with temporary credentials,
which are created on-the-fly from Easy Auth authenticated accounts,
to access various backend applications that cannot directly support
modern authentication methods.
